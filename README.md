The instructions for this assignment:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An environmental engineer is monitoring the amount of rainfall in a particular South American
jungle and wants to calculate the average rainfall based on a variety of sensor readings.
However, some of the sensors produce incorrect data, so she will ignore any readings that are
negative values, since those are obviously incorrect.

In this assignment, you are asked to write a program that calculates the average of
the non-negative numbers in a list, i.e., the numbers greater than or equal to 0.

The code that you write should follow lines 2 and 3 in the code that we have provided, which
create the list of numbers and initialize the average to 0. Write your code starting at line 5 (you
can remove the comments starting at line 5, and may need more space than what is provided),
and be sure that the value of “average” is correctly set before the code reaches the “return
average” statement on line 10. As before, be sure that your code is indented and that you all
your code comes before “return average”.

Also, keep in mind that the goal here is to write a program that would find the average of the
non-negative values of any list, not just the one provided on line 2. That is, don’t simply
calculate the average by hand and then set average to hold that value, but rather write a
program that implements the algorithm.
